      <h1>The taxonomy of neuroscience</h1>
      <h2>A visual map of the most interesting science (proof-of-concept)</h2>
      
      <p><u>What's the problem?<br /></u>
            There are lots of sub-fields within neuroscience, and few of them have definitions or boundaries which everyone agrees on. Also, there are many neuro labs and even more individual researchers. Each have different specialisms, and these are often unrelated to the daily reality of their work. This creates a conundrum for any budding cross-disciplinary neuroscientist, whether in finding collaborators, job-hunting, or searching for the latest literature: <i>how do you find the people who work in a particular area?</i> For example, I might work on Alzheimer's Disease, but searching for my fellow researchers in this area of study will tell me very little about the work which they actually <i>do</i>. They might study the diagnosis of it, the treatment of its symptoms, the neurogenetic basis for its prevalence or the best way to image its progression. These are very different fields and skillsets, all described as "the study of Alzheimer's".
      </p>
            <p>As you can see, our current descriptions of neuroscience's areas of study are not ideal.</p>
      <p><u>How could you split up neuroscience?<br /></u>
            There are two main ways that you can split up the field of neuroscience (aside from the specific goal, which as described above is not ideal).
      </p>
      <p>
            The first is by sub-field. Traditionally neuroscientists have identified areas of study within neuroscience by their sub-field. For example, <i>clinical neuroscience</i> studies the diseases and disorders of the brain and central nervous system, while <i>computational neuroscience</i> mathematically models and simulates the cognition, development, physiology and structure of the brain and central nervous system. The borders between these sub-fields are arbitrary, moving, and indistinct. Sub-fields are categorical.
      </p>
      <p>
            The second is by methods. These can be thought of along a continuum. Researchers within the same sub-field may use very different methods, and researchers within different sub-fields may use similar methods. For example, One researcher may study Alzheimer's using very mathematical methods, and their methods share more with those of a cognitive neuroscientist mathematically modelling decisions than they would share with an Alzheimer's study on the neuropsychiatric treatment of the disease. Methods are continuous.
      </p>
      <p><u>How does this help?<br /></u>
            We can think of the field of neuroscience as a space that different people study in: close-by areas of the space hold similar types of methods. There is no one definition which defines what type of science "belongs" in each area, but we can ask the scientists themselves what they think they do. By doing this, we can empirically show the differences and similarities between neuroscience's areas of study, and make it easier for cross-disciplinary connections to be made.
